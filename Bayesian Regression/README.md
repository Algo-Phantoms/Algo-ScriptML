Bayesian statistics is a powerful technique for probabilistic modelling that has been adopted in a wide range of statistical modelling, 
including Linear Regression models to make a prediction about a system.



Why use Bayesian methods?

*P-values make inferences about the probability of data, not parameter values.

*Posterior distribution: Combination of likelihood and prior

1. sample the posterior distribution.

2. summerize the sample.

3. use the summery to make inferences about parameter values.
